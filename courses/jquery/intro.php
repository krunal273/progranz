    <h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
    <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>
    <p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
    <p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish,
        and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
    <p>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
    <p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
        <li>CSS manipulation</li>
        <li>HTML event methods</li>
        <li>Effects and animations</li>
        <li>AJAX</li>
        <li>Utilities</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><p><b>Tip:</b> In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</p></blockquote>

    <h2>Why jQuery?</h2>
    <p>There are lots of other JavaScript frameworks out there, but jQuery seems 
        to be the most popular, and also the most extendable.</p>
    <p>Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google</li>
        <li>Microsoft</li>
        <li>IBM</li>
        <li>Netflix</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <p><b>Will jQuery work in all browsers?<br>
            </b><br>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have 
            written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same 
            in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer 6!</p>
